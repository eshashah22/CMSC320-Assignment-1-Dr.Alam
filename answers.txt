Q1: Why might be consider using git?                
                                                     
Answer: We might consider using git because it helps
developers manage and track changes in their code. It  
also lets you look at previous versions of your code 
if something goes wrong or you want to see an older 
version. You would also use Git to work with other 
developers and can work at the same time on different 
branches.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give and 
Example and how it might help.

Answer: Data science could be applied to the finance 
field. For example, banks can analyze customer spending 
data. By then using machine learning models, banks will 
be able to detect potential credit card fraud when 
spending patterns do not match those of the customer. 

Q3: What is the difference between merging and rebasing?

Answer: Merging and rebasing both integrate changes from 
one branch to another, but they do it in different ways. 
In merge, the existing branches are not changed in 
anyway, as the histories of both branches are saved. Merge
simply combines two branches into one.  On the other hand,
rebase rewrites the project history, as it creates new 
commits for each commit in the original branch. Thus, it
has a linear project history.

Q4: What skills do you hope to improve during this 
course?

Answer: I hope to improve my proficiency in Python and 
get more comfortable with its libraries. I also hope to 
develop skills in machine learning, NLP, and have a 
strong understanding in graph theory.
