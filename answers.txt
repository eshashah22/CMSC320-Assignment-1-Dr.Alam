Q1: Why might be consider using git?

Answer: We might consider using git because it helps 
developers manage and track changes in their code. It 
also lets you look at previous versions of your code if 
you something goes wrong or you want to see an older version. You would also use Git to work with 
other developers and can work at the same time on different branches.
