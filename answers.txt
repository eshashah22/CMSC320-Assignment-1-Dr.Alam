Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give and 
Example and how it might help.

Answer: Data science could be applied to the finance 
field. For example, banks can analyze customer spending 
data. By then using machine learning models, banks will 
be able to detect potential credit card fraud when 
spending patterns do not match those of the customer.
